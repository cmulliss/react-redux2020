/* has code to determine location + month

2 fn callbacks to getCurrentPosition, first is success callback, followed by failure callback

when we make a classe we are making a class with one method, render attached to it, but can pull in other methods.

class, so can use state now. To get a component to rerender itself we update its state, using setState.

If in render(), the getCurrentPosition will cause repeated rendering, so move it. Supply it with a callback fn too.

in render, we are taking a prop from the states on the App component and passing it a prop down into the SeasonDisplay.
