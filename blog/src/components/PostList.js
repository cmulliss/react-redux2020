/* fetchPosts is an action that we have passed into the connect function as a mapDispatchToProps argument in object form. Because we have done this, the action is now wrapped in the dispatch function and available to us to use as props.

You can confirm this by console logging this.props in that component, you will see fetchPosts listed, along side anything that is currently tracked in your Redux store or component level state.
