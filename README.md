- Warning: Can't call setState on a component that is not yet mounted. This is a no-op, but it might indicate a bug in your application. Instead, assign to `this.state` directly or define a `state = {};` class property with the desired state in the App component.

- avoid doing data loading inside the constructor, just returning jsx

- do your data loading inside componentDidMount()
